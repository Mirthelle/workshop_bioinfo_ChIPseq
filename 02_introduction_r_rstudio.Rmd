# Introduction
__R__ is a programming language designed originally for performing statistical analyses. However, it's potential has been increased and nowadays it can be used for general data analysis, creating atractive plots or even for creating websites! You can download R from the official repository: [CRAN](https://www.r-project.org/). 

> If you have used spreadsheets to calculate stuff, you have already programmed.

In R, you can assign values to variables using `<-`. You don't have to type it everytime, just `Alt`+`-`!

```{r}
variable <- 2342
variable
```

You can use R from the unix command line or download an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as __RStudio__.

# R basics
## Data types
The basic types of variables that can be represented in R are the following:

- _Numeric_. `332`, `0.234`.
- _Character_. `"Barcelona"`, `"woman"`. A special type of character is the class _factor_.
- _Logical_. `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
    
You can check the type of variable using `class()`.

```{block, opts.label="exercise"}
Create one variable of each of the above-mentioned basic types and check that the type is correct using the `class()` function.
```


```{r, solution=TRUE}
var <- "text" # character
class(var)

var <- 3242 # numeric
class(var)

var <- TRUE # logical
class(var)
```


## Arithmetic operators

Operator    | Description
------------|---------------
`+`	        | addition
`-`	        | subtraction
`*`	        | multiplication
`/`	        | division
`^` or `**`	| exponentiation

```{r}
3+4*5.2/2^2
```


## Logical operators

Operator | Description
---------|-------------------
`>`	     | greater than
`>=`     | greater than or equal to
`==`     |	exactly equal to
`!=`     | not equal to

```{r}
# Works with numerics
3 > 2

# And also with characters
"class"=="class"
```


## Data structures

We can combine several data types into more complex structures. The different structures one can create in R are the following:

- __Vectors__. Consists on a concatenation `c()` of values. The type of all values should be the same.
```{r}
vector <- c(0,1,2,3,4,6)
vector
```

- __Matrices__. Are basically vectors, but with 2 dimensions (rows and columns). You can create a matrix using `matrix()`. You can check which arguments you can pass to the matrix function typing `?matrix` or `help(matrix)`
```{r}
mat <- matrix(vector, nrow=2)
mat
```

```{block, opts.label="exercise"}
As an example we just generated a vector of numbers. Try to generate a __vector with letters (characters)__ from 'a' to 'f' and then convert it to a matrix with 2 columns.
```

```{r, solution=TRUE}
vector <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f')
mat <- matrix(vector, ncol=2)
mat
```



- __Lists__.
- __Dataframes__.
